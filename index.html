                <h3>Winning the Kaplan Scholarship</h3>
                <p>Chadrick was selected as one of the seven students out of over 1000 students who applied throughout the New York city area. The scholarship covered tuition for Chadrick’s last year at BMCC, and then cover the tuition gap—what’s not covered by financial aid—and provide other scholarships at the University of Rochester where he continues his education for up to $10,000 a year. The scholarship generally looks for students who exhibit great leadership potential, who are giving back to their communities, excelling academically, and with a little extra nurturing through our program, can go on to make greater impact on society.</p>

                <p>For the past two summers, Chadrick has had the opportunity to intern at the AIG’s internal audit group in the New York city area. After an evaluation of his performance at the company, he was then offered a full-time position upon his graduation. One of Chadrick’s major projects at AIG was to audit the Global Shared Services -  Operations and Pricing centers for effectiveness of various key controls through supporting documentation, client meetings and walkthroughs of business processes.

                <p>Throughout Chadrick’s tenure in the City University of New York (CUNY) system, he had the opportunity to give back to his community by taking part in the CUNY service corps. This program provided students with the opportunity to intern at different organizations to help foster economic growth. Chadrick was able to intern at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as part of the program. At the bank he was able to plan, execute, and communicate results of audits. In addition, assessed risk on audits and communicated preliminary risks to audit teams and audit management. He was then able to become an ambassador for the program to allow other students to learn about such opportunities.</p>
